## Themes:

**Cyberpunk:**
A cyberpunk theme, with some throwback elements seen in the dieselpunk and steampunk themes.

**Dieselpunk:**
A theme similar to the Steampunk theme, but more industrial oriented. Base theme comprised of dark iron/steel plating with the use of rust and blued steel for color accents

**Itself:**
Each app is rendered as a reflection of its own identity, _its own self_. The appâ€™s function or identity defines the aesthetic. For example: steampunk for Steam, a desktop computer in a home office for XFCE, and a blocky world for Prism.

**Steampunk:**
A steampunk theme with gold/brass and otherwise earthen tones, featuring an ornate border compised of gears and piping to match.
