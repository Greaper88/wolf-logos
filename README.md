Themes:

Dieselpunk:
A theme similar to the Steampunk theme, but more industrial oriented. Base theme comprised of dark iron/steel plating with the use of rust and blued steel for color accents

Itself:
This theme doesn't really have an overall theme. Each individual logo is based around _itself_! That is to say that all logos are themed around the logo and intent of the program. For example: steampunk for Steam, a desktop computer in a home office for XFCE, and a blocky world for Prism.

Steampunk:
A steampunk theme with gold/brass and otherwise earthen tones, featuring an ornate border compised of gears and piping to match.
